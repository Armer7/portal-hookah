# portal-hookah

 there was a real order. It was necessary to transfer the ready-made [pages](https://frizzzbe.github.io/Portal-Hookah/index.html) HTML, CSS and js to VUE SPA. Move only pages. Further conversion to a Laravel mobile app should have already been done by another person. For some unknown reason, the customer disappeared. I decided to do this project for the sake of experience. Here's a mock up [design](https://www.figma.com/file/ZsxmTGnoniG4TkCNstmglR/Portal-Hookah-Copy?node-id=60%3A54)

### Used FrameWorks
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/index.html) with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/). Debugging was done in browser devtools and vue-devtools.

Typeset - HTML5, CSS3.
